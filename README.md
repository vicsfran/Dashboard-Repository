  # Placed Orders = count of orders placed.
  # Delivered Orders = count of orders, exclude those with blank delivery data.

  # Open Orders = accumulated value of the difference between orders placed and delivered over the period.

  # Order Fill Rate (OFR) = average of days between the order date and the CTE issuance date. Represents the time that the operation takes to pick an order, including all activities â€” from the recipient of the purchase order to shipment.

  # Order Cycle Time (OCT) = average days between order and delivery date. It aims to measure how long the company takes to make a delivery, from dispatch to arrival at the destination, that is, the overall efficiency of the operation.

  # On Time = number of orders delivered with a delivery date less than or equal to the expected date. Measures order timeliness.

  # % On Time = proportion between orders On Time in relation to the total orders delivered.

  # In Full = number of orders with zero occurrences of returns. Evaluates compliance with specifications agreed with the customer, such as quality, dimensions, quantity and price.

  # % In Full = proportion between In Full orders in relation to the total number of delivered orders.

  # % OTIF = % On Time and % In Full multiplication. This segmentation makes it possible to identify whether the origin of the problem is in the delivery or in the     expedition. Low On Time means that there is a need to review the transport process or improve negotiation of expected delivery data. On the other hand, a low In Full may indicate problems in processing, sorting, packaging, checking or dispatching the products.
